* Shoot and Catch
this is a game i am making
** Idea
- you control a simple character in a top down view
- you get attacked by enemies that walk toward you, stop when
  they get close ish, and fire at you, they might back away
  if you get too close to them
- firing a bullet costs you 1HP, catching your own bullet back
  gets you 1HP back
-
